# TIC TAC TOE
This project was one of the first I completed at the beginning of my programming journey, inspired by the Complete Python Bootcamp by Jose Portilla on Udemy. Developed using clean and readable code, it helped solidify my understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and function interactions in Python. The game demonstrates an ability to structure small-scale applications effectively and has served as a valuable learning tool in both logic design and code organization. Through feedback from other developers, I’ve also recognized its potential for further development—such as integrating an AI opponent or building a graphical user interface—making it a strong foundation for more advanced features. Overall, the project reflects both problem-solving ability and a commitment to writing clear, maintainable code.
